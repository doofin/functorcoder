"""Complex systems, Chaos and ecosystem part 2: mathematical foundation of dynamic system 


Previously, I have introduced the basic concepts and examples of nonlinear dynamics and chaos, as well as the current reductionist philosophy in contrast to the dynamical systems approach in "Complex systems, Chaos and ecosystem part 1: the defiance to reductionism", now it's time to dive into dynamical systems, the mathematical foundation of complex systems.

# dynamical systems
Dynamical systems are a branch of mathematics focused on the study
